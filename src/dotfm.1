.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdotfm\fP is designed to be simple and easy to use. It's really just a
short-hand for managing symlinks of dotfiles (it's also helpful if

everytime you want to modify it).

at the known install location.
.PP
If DOTFILE is not recognised by \fBdotfm\fP, then you'll be prompted for
an install location and aliases to reference the dotfile by when
using \fBdotfm\fP.
.RE

"sudo make install" - copy \fBdotfm\fP to the install location (recommended
for most users).

"sudo make link" - create a symlink of \fBdotfm\fP from its current location
to the install location (useful if you want to modify it frequently).

nano will be used.
.SH HINTS
I would recommend modifying the "KNOWN DOTFILES" array in src/ dotfm.py
to suite your own needs.
.PP
If you can think of more standard-dotfiles that you think
should be present in "KNOWN DOTFILES" feel free to get in touch and
contribute to the list.

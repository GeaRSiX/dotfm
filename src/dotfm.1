.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdotfm\fP is designed to be simple and easy to use. It's really just a short-hand for managing symlinks of dotfiles (it's also helpful if you don't want to remember or type out the location of a dotfile everytime you want to modify it).
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP

\fB-h\fP \fB--help\fP

.SH COMMANDS
Multiple DOTFILE args can be passed to each command.
.TP
.B
install <DOTFILE>\.\.\.
DOTFILE should be a filepath of the dotfile to install.
If the filename of DOTFILE is known, a symlink will be created at the install location (found in KNOWN_LOCATIONS).
If the filename is not recognised, then you'll be prompted for an install location an aliases to call the dotfile by.
.TP
.B
remove <DOTFILE>\.\.\.
DOTFILE should be an alias for the dotfile to remove.
Remove the file located at the install location of the dotfile with an alias matching DOTFILE. Will only remove if the file has been installed by \fBdotfm\fP (found in DOTFM_CSV_FILE).
.TP
.B
edit <DOTFILE>\.\.\.
DOTFILE should be an alias for the dotfile to edit.
Open the corresponding DOTFILE in $EDITOR or (if $EDITOR is not set) nano.
.TP
.B
list [<DOTFILE>\.\.\.]
DOTFILE is optional, if set it should be an alias of the dotfile to list.
Display a table of the install location and aliases of all or specified dotfiles.
.SH INSTALL
Go to the source folder of \fBdotfm\fP and run either "sudo make link" or "sudo make install".
The link option will create a symlink of the script from it's current location (useful if you want to modify it frequently).
The install option will copy it to the install location (recommended for most users).
.PP
By default the install location of \fBdotfm\fP is /usr/local/bin/\fBdotfm\fP. To modify this, just edit the value of DESTBINDIR in the Makefile.
.SH UNINSTALL
Go to the source folder of \fBdotfm\fP and run "sudo make uninstall"
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B
EDITOR
The text editor to edit dotfiles with. If not present, nano will be used.
.SH KNOWN DOTFILES
I would recommend modifying the "KNOWN_DOTFILES" array in src/dotfm.py to suite your own needs. I've tried to put most of the standard dotfiles in there, however it's not exhaustive (although I do plan on adding to it over-time).
.PP
Doing this will allow you to easily install dotfiles that you often use which aren't currently present KNOWN_DOTFILES (instead of having to specify the install location and aliases for it everytime).
